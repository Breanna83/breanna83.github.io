    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I think that inside the mystery balck box is a second cup that the water goes through before it reaches the nozzle at the bottom</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery balck box is a black box that we have to figure out what's in it. My initial observation was that the same amount of water that was going in was coming out. Our initial investigation was that what went in didnâ€™t always come out. So then as a class we 
Did more and more tests. We saw that after a while, more water started to come out. My initial approach to figuring out ways to make a model and try to get the same reaction from the box. Our model's key structures were a tube coming from the funnel leading to a cup on the side of the box, another tube coming from that cup leading to another tube at the bottom. We tested our model by doing the same thing that happened to the black box. For example on some of the tests a little bit of water came out while other times a lot came out. For example on trial #1 we put 250mL and 150mL came out. Another time we but 100mL in and 40mL came out.</p>
