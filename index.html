    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I think that inside the mystery balck box is a second cup that the water goes through before it reaches the nozzle at the bottom</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery balck box is a black box that we have to figure out what's in it. My initial observation was that the same amount of water that was 
      going in was coming out. Our initial investigation was that what went in didn’t always come out. So then as a class we did more and more tests. 
      We saw that after a while, more water started to come out. My initial approach to figuring out ways to make a model and try to get the same reaction 
      from the box. Our model's key structures were a tube coming from the funnel leading to a cup on the side of the box, another tube coming from that 
      cup leading to another tube at the bottom. We tested our model by doing the same thing that happened to the black box. For example on some of the 
      tests a little bit of water came out while other times a lot came out. For example on trial #1 we put 250mL and 150mL came out. Another time we 
      but 100mL in and 40mL came out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>Pt I</p>
    <p>For this project we used the model approach. In this case, a model is a copy of what we think is in the black box. Models show what's happening and 
      what’s where. They might not always work because you don’t always have the materials. They can be useful because they show what is happening to the 
      actual thing.</p>
    <p>Pt II</p>
    <p>Models show what's happening and what’s where. They might not always work because you don’t always have the materials. They can 
      be useful because they show what is happening to the actual thing.</p>
    <p>Pt III</p>
    <p>An alternate claim could be that there’s not a second cup in the model, but just a straight tube connecting the funnel to the output
      tube.If that was the case, the same amount of water that goes in comes out. AKA if 25mL went in then 25mL would come out. </p>
